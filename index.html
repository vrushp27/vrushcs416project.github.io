        <h3>
            In today's world, many people buy cars without checking the mileage. Most of the young population nowadays
            ignores the fact that gas is super expensive as well as it's polluting the environment. Slowly, the entire world 
            is leaning towards buying electric vehicles; however, many people still think they're expensive and not worth 
            the price; however, the don't think that they will end up spending so much money in gas over many years if 
            they keep that low MPG car. This Narrative Visualization will further explain different charts in how 
            you can save a lot of money in buying specific brands of cars that give good MPG as well as leaning them towards getting
            an electric car which will be better for the environment.
